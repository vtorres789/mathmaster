Math Solver in Multiple Programming Languages

This program is a reiteration of a project I worked on in middle school, originally in BASIC on a TI-83 calculator. That project was fun, and the original purpose was to find an easy way to quickly finish my math homework at the time with algebra, geometry and trigonometry. As I programmed away, and figured out the logic, and how to implement the math formulas and principles through various trials and workarounds, I realized I actually understood the math fundamentals more deeply now. Ironically, by designing this program, I made myself so proficient with the subject matter that I actually didn't need my program to do homework and much less tests. 

Since then, my calculator got stolen, I recovered it, and then it got stolen again, and I actually didn't have a backup saved anywhere (or maybe I did, but I don't know where it is). However, the concept lives on, and I plan on using a more advanced platform now to practice my programming skills beyond BASIC, and into programming languages like python, javascript, and beyond. Looking forward to the process.
